# Password Generator

# Description
Random Password generator that allows a user to set a few variables then generate a secure password. I have added prompts that allows the user to select how long they would like their password, If they want uppercase, lowercase, numbers or special characters. With all of those options there are measures to make sure the user inputs the correct things in the field. If not there is another prompt that will tell the user to enter something in the correct format.
