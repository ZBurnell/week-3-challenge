# Password Generator

# Description
Random Password generator that allows a user to set a few variables then generate a secure password. I have added prompts that allows the user to select how long they would like their password, If they want uppercase, lowercase, numbers or special characters. With all of those options there are measures to make sure the user inputs the correct things in the field. If not there is another prompt that will tell the user to enter something in the correct format.

Your Task
This week's Challenge requires you to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
The password can include special characters. If you’re unfamiliar with these, see this list of password special characters from the OWASP Foundation.
